# workflowyCodeFormatter
A simple and lightweight solution to the WorkFlowy code dilemma.


===
Makes backtick wrapped text look like code! {openSource}
An open source extension to make backtick wrapped text look like code in WorkFlowy.

Unlike 'WorkFlowy for coders', this solution is lightweight, pure JavaScript, and still allows editing text in all views.

Any text wrapped in 1 or 3 backticks will be rendered as code (inspired by Markdown syntax).
